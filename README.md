# ch13webEmployeeList

In the book, the exercise that ties it all together (section 13.9) merges two text files together and creates an HTML document. You need to create that project with some modifications, then add a third text file to the mix.

You have learned previously about creating HTML pages. You need to include all the proper tags and content for an HTML page here. These aren't shown in the project in the book, but you must include the doctype statement, the opening and closing html tag, the head tag and its contents, and the body tag and its contents.

The project in the book merges two text files, the black fileDownload black file and the blue fileDownload blue file. You will add a green fileDownload green file to merge with the others -- be sure to modify the logic so it works with 3 files, not just 2. Be sure to use the files provided here. After you have created your C++ project, the root folder contains another folder with the same name. Click into that second folder, and store the text files there. This folder should have a debug folder, the ReadMe.txt file, the "cpp" file (which is the source file for the project), and a few others -- if you don't see those, you're not in the correct folder. When you run the project, you'll see a console window that asks for the input file names and the output file name, and that's all. Be sure to use a file name that ends in ".htm" for the output file name. When the project completes, go into that same folder where you stored the text files to find the output file. You can open it with NotePad++ and launch the web browser, or double click on the file name to launch a web browser.

This is how the HTML page will appear in a web browser:

The content at the top is different from the book project; be sure to include that information in your project. For the list, use a single paragraph tag with break tags after each name.

Take a screenshot of the result.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
